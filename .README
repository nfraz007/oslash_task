# API Design

I have used Rest API with json output which can be read by any client.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "a success message",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "a error message",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Unauthenticated Response

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Please login.",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Not found Response

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "data not found.",
  "data": {}
}
```

# Authentication

JWT (json web token) is a perfect way to create a new api token with some additional payload and expiry time.
when a user is success fully login then I am generating a token and storing in `user_tokens` table.

> A user can have multiple tokens

# Database

I have choosen mysql for this project. Mysql is a great database which has relational capabilities.

- we can store millions of record in table.
- for speed up queries, we can add indexes.
- we can even join the table if we need.
- if size of database is increasing then we can use database cluster as well.

# Table design

we can definatly scale this structure but after a certain point. mysql search is not an efficiant way to search the record. we can use elastic search or algolia for this which performance is far better than mysql

# Postman

To test this api, you can use postman client. I have also added postman collection in the root folder

# Installation

```sh
# pull code from github
git clone https://github.com/nfraz007/oslash_task.git

# run dependencies installation
npm install

# make sure you are running mysql in your local
# create database oslash_task
# put the credential in .env file
# start the project
npm run start
```
